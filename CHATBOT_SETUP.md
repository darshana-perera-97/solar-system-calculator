## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start:**
   - Check if Node.js is installed: `node --version`
   - Verify dependencies: `npm install`
   - Check port availability (default: 3000)

2. **Chatbot not responding:**
   - Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:3031/api/health`
   - Check OpenAI API key in `.env` file
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **CORS errors:**
   - Backend CORS is configured for `http://localhost:3031`
   - Update frontend URL if using different port

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by adding to your `.env`:
```
DEBUG=true
NODE_ENV=development
```

## üìà Future Enhancements

- "How long do solar panels last?"
- "What's the environmental impact?"

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify backend server is running
3. Check OpenAI API key configuration
4. Review the backend logs for detailed error messages
